    AI and Sentience are two completely terms that have been radically twisted in recent years due to the fear of the two combined, AI Sentience. Society views these two ideas together much too frequently, allowing for false narratives and red herrings to be passed around, only pushing fear further for what could replace us in the upcoming and near future, but in reality such topics are nowhere near to become the nightmare that many think of (Metz, 2022). However, if in the future, AI does become sentient, such would be beneficial but could be easily manipulated and misused for encroaching or harmful values. Such problems though, are deeply rooted within Humans and those who choose to create such sentient AIs. Humans cannot be defined as innately good or evil, through such human actions can we define something as good or evil. In the case of AI they are mostly utilized for engineering purposes but as we progress into the future, AI becomes much more prevalent within software and machinery but can also present a terrible opposite.
    <br>
    For example the recent image creating tool named DALLE, is AI that pulls data from the internet and tries its best to produce a coherent image based on the descriptive prompt given to it. This is a healthy example of how AI can be implemented into humans' daily lives in the future. It’s up to many to decide whether or not AI should play a bigger role in society, one example of this is GitHub’s co-pilot, to have a sentient AI that adapts to situations and solve problems quicker than a human could, it leaves no room for any difficulties (Roose, 2022). However sentient AI could healthily implemented by allowing them to be put in difficult situations that require quick and fast adaptability, an AI would be able to efficiently adapt to high level situations quickly and allow such situations like military operations or long tasks such as scouting out a desert, which would not require as much resources as a human would need.
    <br>
    However all these benefits have a definite negative, society views sentient AIs as hostile to many factors like the workforce, one’s security, and many views of traditionalism. And while many of these are red herrings they prepare us for a future that could come with increasing chances, AIs would be able to take over a large majority of the workforce with hard labor, saving costs by many folds, covering healthcare expenses, salaries, and automated work. This would put many across the globe out of a job, although this may open up new jobs, the encroaching labor force removal would cause unprecedented change and panic. Another tangent would be abuse of this technology within the stock market, to trade within an instant would cause massive volatility within the market and single handedly upturn economies quickly (Thomas, 2021). We already see in our modern world the many that hold unfair viewpoints and racial prejudice, introducing AIs into society would have many trying to revert back to traditionalism and reject modern technology, creating a fracture between social groups and political beliefs.
    <br>
    Overall, AIs would be beneficial for the future, but sentience is a hot topic that can be argued from many different perspectives, and many of them come with a fair take, putting many out of jobs all the while twisting economies around their finger due the technology. It is important to understand fully and implement such technology carefully and healthily around the world. These highly adaptive beings could lead for unrecorded growth among humans, but anyone with a single bit of malicious intent could warp the way we humans view AIs and such sentience forever.
