  Each and every website has their own "fingerprint", accompanied by one's own domain name, certificate name, and the fingerprint itself, made up of a hash, defined by a hexadecimal string. Within all web addresses, there is a small string at the beginning of such, "HTTPS", this was meant to be an upgrade from HTTP, otherwise known as "Hypertext Transfer Protocol", such upgrade entailed a secure, encrypted connection to a website and block any of those who wished to maliciously or not "monitor, watch, record and log the actions of users on the Internet could do so easily, simply by eavesdropping on the data moving through the wires"(Gibson, 2020). Many wished to combat this change for security within the Internet, such as employers, schools, and even government agencies as a whole, thus creating "HTTPS Proxy Appliances"(Gibson, 2020). These appliances were purposefully made to examine user traffic between websites and disconnect websites with the HTTPS protocol and the encryption that it provided. 
  <br>
  With the rise of such a powerful appliance, it spread like wildfire to those wishing to pursue this traffic maliciously, because of this a term surfaced to labelize the type of attack such enacted swiftly and covertly. MITM or Man-in-the-Middle can be defined as simply as it's name, when a user connects to a website, a perpetrator of sorts may position himself in between the user and the website using the proxy appliance, and steal the once encrypted data and sensitive info the user may have input to the website unknowing that the website was actually spoofed, or website was made to look the same but function towards the perpetrators plan to steal sensitive information (Imperva, 2019). A hash code identifies a website and is medium to encrypt such data, making it harder at the very least to halt malicious activity, a function known as SHA1 creates such a hash, made up of a hexadecimal string. However not all hash codes are made the same, a bad one would work inefficiently at keeping data and such, safe and encrypted, while a better one would still do the basic qualities of hash such as encrypting and storing data, while also changing configuration for both the user and browser sides (Seon, 2022).
 <br>
 Another branch of security and encryption within the Internet that also branches out into the real world, are Certificate Authorities which tie real world documents from businesses, phone numbers, and even records utilized for business analytics to create "an assertion of its identity" (Gibson, 2020). These Certificate Authorities tie in other Certificate Authorities to verify the other, creating a network of valid and reputable website identifiers, allowing for easier and safer interaction within the internet, but soon after elusive techniques allowed for proxy appliances to create a "trusted" certificate which would allow for another Man-in-the-Middle or SSL interception cyberattack (Gibson, 2020). However, such an interception is capable of being prevented, for this to take place a website may have two security keys derived from the website's security certificates, one being public and the other, private (Gibson, 2020). Going back to the cyber attack viewpoint, to spoof the website one must get the private key, encrypted by the public key, so when the private key is spoofed, the public key, one tries to copy, will always be wrong or different, while still managing to keep the security key safe (Gibson, 2020).
<br>
 To identify when such is happening or when a website is spoofed from a security breach of the website, you must differentiate between the fraudulent hexadecimal hash from the true one for the website, any browser allows one to see the certificate name and fingerprint, allowing for any user to keep oneself safe from a false positive, such as viewing a website is secure with HTTPS while the fingerprint is spoofed, and a false negative, where a proxy tool might create a spoofed website and "also-fraudulent Certificate Authority that was previously planted inside the user's browser or computer" entirely to fool the user(Gibson, 2020). While spying on one's own communications online is unlawful to enact in self-interest, "It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person not acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication where such person is a party to the communication or where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State" (US Code, 2018). This code allows for internet source providers, government agencies, or even education institutions to allow for an investigation and to eavesdrop on one's own internet footprint.
