  I am a concurrent senior level student with Allen High School and Collin College via dual enrollment. My hobbies are spending times with friends and playing videogames. Growing up I always wanted to be a vdeo game tester, specifically for mariokart, just the thought of the career sounded like a actual dream come true. although as I grew I realized how depressing the job actually was, reaeating the same minuscule task over and over to find and nitpick small areas of interest to bugfix and clean up. Soon after, I turned my sights to computer based skills. Which now formulates into today, I now love both the hardware and software sides of computer, which pushed me to pursue computer science. In the future, I hope to find myself in computer science/software engineering based career, or even within electrical engineering, after pursuing studies in college. I also hope to build with practice and creative thinking skills in order to help me become a better programmer for my future and my career.

I was born in New York but moved to Texas when I was a little over a year old. Although the common misconception about living in Texas is all about the countryside, accents, and cowboys, I grew up in the contrary, with technology ever-evolving around me, I of course grew accustomed and fascinated to it. Starting from type writers to mobiles phones, I loved all of it and was more than intrgued to personally investigate how these worked from the base mechanic of electrons moving through components, to the software side of the nitty, gritty assembly language. Within school, noticing they had a computer science class, I was excited to set down a educational basis for programing that I can reference to in the future because I started early. WIth such in mind, I decided to dedicate myself to this carrer path, taking electives that only benefit me in the future, such courses include statistics, pre-calculas, computer science I, and computer maitenance, within such classes I learned both hardware and software sides of computers, just as I aspired when I was younger, I hope learning such content earlier will help me delve and focus on a singular point of interest in the future.
