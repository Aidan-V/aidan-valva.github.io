<p>  I am a concurrent senior level student with Allen High School and Collin College via dual enrollment. My hobbies are spending times with friends and playing videogames. Growing up I always wanted to be a vdeo game tester, specifically for mariokart, just the thought of the career sounded like a actual dream come true. although as I grew I realized how depressing the job actually was, reaeating the same minuscule task over and over to find and nitpick small areas of interest to bugfix and clean up. Soon after, I turned my sights to computer based skills. Which now formulates into today, I now love both the hardware and software sides of computer, which pushed me to pursue computer science. In the future, I hope to find myself in computer science/software engineering based career, or even within electrical engineering. </p>
