  <h1> Computer Science Experience </h1>
 <body>   
<p> In Computer Science I, offered through Allen High School, we learned about the basics of bash, linux, surface dive into number systems, and emacs integrated within a shell, locking in muscle memories, good practice, and general knowledge to navigate the commands within swift, apple's own coding language. And within Swift, we learned the basics commands to program and imagine our very own creations, one example of these creations is known as an independent project, or an ISP. This ISP is a project made by a small group of students, creating whatever their hearts desired. <p>
    <title>
      <h1> ISP Concept </h1>
	  </title>
	  <p> For my ISP, my group created Simon Says, the plastic mini-game most people played with as a child, but in a virtual form! Using Unity, and the coding language C#, me and two other students created using colors and sound, the player will try to memorize the pattern of the color flashes and tap the designated colors in order to get a high score, thiss will go on until the player fails to memorize the pattern. If they lose, a game over screen will appear and show the high score, and offer another attempt. </p>

	    <h1> Motivation </h1>
		</title>
<p> The two other students and I wanted to create the game to relive beloved memories of our childhood when we would spend countless hours with friends playing Simon Says. Even as highschoolers, this game is still enjoyable to us, so we thought why don't we make it for our own project, reimagined. </p>

    <p> this snippet of code details a variable "bleep", which is an alias for our in game audio, at the start it lists void and the bleeps equal a list, the list allows the bleep to store a counter that keeps track of the amount of bleeps compunding per round, while the "bleepCount++" allows the bleep function to actually compound per round, correctly outputting the number of beeps equal to number of round correctly guessed. <p>

    <p> The variable seen as "GameObject gameButton" is for the 4 different colors of the simon says game, while instantiate readies the visuals of the four corners. The gameButton variable has multiple different lines, the first one being to change the parent window of the child window, aligning the button visuals with the actual hitboxes, next the visuals or colors of the buttons within the index which hold the 4 colors, being blue, red, green, and yellow. The next being to align all the game audio sounds, making sure they dont relapse and overlap other audio cues.</p>

	<h1> Conclusions </h1>
	    </title>
    <p> Overall, it was a difficult experience to acclimate our self to unity, as we first tried within IGIS but could not figure out how to display our visuals, and found we could not input sound, severely limiting our progress, but within this project we found ourselves learning new languages in a new envrioment, allowing for experience if needed within the future. Although I am glad our group was able to complete the game and allow ourselves the satisfaction of our own creation. </p>
