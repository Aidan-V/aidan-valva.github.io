<body>
  <p>   As a high school student who looks eagerly to my own future, I feel it is imperative that I build skills and retain good practice through the building of many projects and collaboration with other students. Tracking and looking back on my previous projects would not only help show my growth but refresh my memory on a topic I might have focused in on for a project. As I dive deeper into a programming career, I will more than likely expand outside of swift as a language, it is important to realize that I mmust track my understanding of swift on a regular schedule, making sure to not lose any muscle memories or good practice of the basics, so when and if I come bakc to swift I will atleast remember the basics while refreshing my proficiency. To expand further, within Computer Science II, we have already practiced HTML and CSS in order to create the website you, the reader, are reading this on, although I have a surface level knowledge, I have a clue that we might be diving into these languages even further. Both outside of school or not, if I practice different languages in different enviroments it is important to log it as mentioned before, in order to hold on to differentor various language basics and allow myself to reference different projects I might have worked on previously to real life situations, be it in class or within a career path, in no way will it become useless. Both highlighting my growth as a a student and showcasing my previous work this portfolio will be primarily utilzed for my future and to gradually add achievements to my professional resume.  For both expereience and a general building of knowledge, a digital portfolio adds to your wealth of experience and allows you to take advantage of your jumpstart that one already built, with this hopefully gains the ability to attract others who are, too, intrigued with computers in general, I hope not only to share my portfolio with my school, but also to represent my growth. </p>
